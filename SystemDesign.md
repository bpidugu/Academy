## System Design Concepts

1. Scalability: System's capacity to grow without performance drop.
2. Reliability: Dependable Operation over time
3. Availability: Readiness for immediate use
4. Efficiency: Resouce Use optimazation
5. Maintainability: Simplicity in upgrading and repair
6. Consistency: Steady operational behavior
7. Latency: Delay inreponse to requests
8. Throughput: Volume of processed requests
9. Fault tolerance: Functioning despite failures
10. Load Balancing: Equal Workload distribution
11. Data Replication: Copying Data for reliability
12. Caching: Temporary data storage for speed
13. Concurrency Control: Simultaneous Operation Management
14. Partitioning/Sharding: Segmenting Data for Efficiency
15. CAP Theorem: Balancing Consistency and Avaialablity against Partition Tolerance
16. Database Indexing: Enhancing Data retrieval spped
17. API Design: Structuring application interfaces
18. Microservices Architecture: Builiding with small, independent services
19. Security: Protecting System and data integrity
20. Monitoring & Logging: Overseeing system performance and activities
21. Service Discovery: Locating and connecting services in a network
22. Rate Limiting: Restricting the number of requests a user can make
23. Disaster Receovery: Preparing for and recovering from data loss
24. Message Queuing: Managing communication between processes
